## Aim
The aim of Rpart application is to demostrate the use of the prp funciton in the rpart.port packages and illustrate the visual effect of different input parameter values to the prp function. 

The rpart.plot R package plots rpart trees (also known as CART trees). It extends the functions in the rpart package.

Further information about rpart.port package:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart.plot/
